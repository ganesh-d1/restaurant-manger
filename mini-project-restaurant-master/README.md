# Restaurant
A mini project on restaurant billing system developed JAVA in third year of my engineering.

It has two modules :
1) Owner
2) Customer

The owner can add, delete, update the menu items and the customer can order food available in menu. 
A bill is also generated for customer which includes the total amount with GST.

Customer.java : It has the functionalities of a customer like ordering food, seeing menu, etc.

RestaurantOwner.java : It has the functionalities of restaurant owner to add food into menu, update prices, etc.

RestaurantApplication.java : This is the main class file which has the entire Restaurant Application. To execute the program, run this file.

GST.java : Its an interface which defines the GST interest rate.
